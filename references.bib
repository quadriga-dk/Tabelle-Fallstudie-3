  abstract  = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

This research aims to influence the development of patient portals within electronic health records by understanding and addressing the challenges involved in acquiring, interpreting, and displaying this data set. In particular, we need to ensure that the presentation of these data is accessible and understandable by diverse populations.},

	abstract = {The importance of analytics and visualization tools has been growing over the last decades to handle big data which steamed from all aspects of life. The focus of this paper was on visualization as a crucial tool in presenting complex raw data and modelling results to provide easy-to-understand actionable information that facilitate decision-making. However, limited research distinguished between “data visualization” and “model visualization”, which has been clearly made in this paper. Furthermore, this paper aimed to shed light on the importance of interactive visualizations to compliment statistical data modelling using R and Shiny for its advanced capabilities. Specifically, a methodology has been proposed based on a hybrid development lifecycle that adopts the Agile Software Development Lifecycle and the Data Analytics Lifecycle. Finally, by presenting a case study to model the dynamics of COVID-19, it was found that R and Shiny alongside the proposed hybrid development lifecycle significantly reduced the amount of time required to build visually interactive applications. The reported results highlighted the effectiveness of the adopted approach in assisting and guiding researchers and developers in building interactive applications that leverage Big Data Analytics.},

With the help of this book, you'll be able to explore the functionalities of Dash for visualizing data in different ways. Interactive Dashboards and Data Apps with Plotly and Dash will first give you an overview of the Dash ecosystem, its main packages, and the third-party packages crucial for structuring and building different parts of your apps. You'll learn how to create a basic Dash app and add different features to it. Next, you’ll integrate controls such as dropdowns, checkboxes, sliders, date pickers, and more in the app and then link them to charts and other outputs. Depending on the data you are visualizing, you'll also add several types of charts, including scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, histograms, and maps, as well as explore the options available for customizing them. By the end of this book, you'll have developed the skills you need to create and deploy an interactive dashboard, handle complexities and code refactoring, and understand the process of improving your application.What you will learnFind out how to run a fully interactive and easy-to-use appConvert your charts to various formats including images and HTML filesUse Plotly Express and the grammar of graphics for easily mapping data to various visual attributesCreate different chart types, such as bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, maps, and moreExpand your app by creating dynamic pages that generate content based on URLsImplement new callbacks to manage charts based on URLs and vice versaWho this book is forThis Plotly Dash book is for data professionals and data analysts who want to gain a better understanding of their data with the help of different visualizations and dashboards – and without having to use JS.
